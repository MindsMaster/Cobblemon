### Additions
- Added the Campfire Pot, made from apricorns and placed onto campfires.
  - This pot can be used to make bait for fishing, Poké Cakes, Lure Cakes, local specialties, and potions (less efficiently than a brewing stand).
  - There is a different pot for each apricorn colour because at this point I think we may have an addiction.
- Added Aprijuice, made from the Campfire Pot using apricorns with seasoning to give flavours.
  - Aprijuice can be fed to ride-able Pokémon to improve their riding characteristics, depending on the flavour and the Pokémon's nature.

### Datapack and Addon Changes
- Renamed the fishing_baits datapack folder to spawn_bait_effects.
- Added `seasonings` datapack folder for controlling usable items in the campfire pot and what colour and flavour they apply.
- Added campfire pot recipe type, which you could use to make anything work as fishing bait.
