/**
 * A [SpawningInfluence] that normalizes the weights of buckets based on a tier system. The idea is that
 * normally the rarest buckets are MUCH rarer than the most common buckets, but in some cases we want
 * those distances to be closer to each other. This is usually for when we're doing fewer spawn actions
 * overall, meaning that the rarest buckets become very harsh, or we want to apply lure bonuses.
 *
 * The [tier] is an integer stepping up through different degrees of normalization. This is used with [gradient]
 * and [firstTier] to control the rate at which the tiers move the buckets. The equation for the new
 * weight of a bucket is `weight ^ (1 / normalizationFactor)`. This means that a normalization factor of 1
 * will not change the weights at all, and a normalization factor of 2 will make each weight turn into its
 * square root, and so on. As this number grows, the closer the bucket weights will be to each other.
 *
 * The normalizationFactor is calculated as `initial + (gradient * tier)`.
